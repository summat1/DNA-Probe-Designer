## Functional Specification

Our **parameter fitting package** allows researchers to find the ideal parameters for their reaction model. Our easy-to-use platform can be used by anyone from wet-lab researchers with minimal coding experience to data science professionals.


**What We Provide**

Our package will provide researchers with: 

1. Suitable parameters for their reaction models based on various fitting algorithms
2. Optimal fit between the model and the data
3. Insight into parameters and their meanings

**User Interaction**
* *Parameter Fitting*: Users will input their experimental data and existing models into the system. The package will then apply fitting algorithms to identify the best parameters for the given data.
* *Model Optimization*: Researchers can adjust their models based on suggestions from our optimization algorithms.
* *Sensitivity Analysis*: Users will be able to explore how variations in specific parameters influence the outcomes of their reaction models.

**Preliminary Project Plan**

10/25/23 - 11/01/23:
* Validate use cases via interviews with mentors and researchers
* Decide which parameter fitting algorithms to implement

11/02/23 - 11/09/23:
* Begin to implement classes and methods to optimize reaction models
* Design strategies for seamless user interaction with our tools
