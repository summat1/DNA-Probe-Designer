Joe wants us to add more info about the output - what is shown?
* What information will the user receive from our library when going through the standard use case?
* How many probes will we recommend to the user?
* What will be the structure of the output? How will we consolidate information to show the user?

Also, does this already exist? (Joe doesn't really mind if it does, but good to know anyways)
Also, what will our reference genome be?
