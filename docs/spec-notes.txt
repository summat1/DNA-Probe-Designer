Joe wants us to add more info about the output - what is shown?
* What information will the user receive from our library when going through the standard use case?
--> the optimal probe sequences and the context/info that makes them the optimal choices
--> graphical + numerical representation
* How many probes will we recommend to the user?
--> as many as cross the threshold for compatability
* What will be the structure of the output? How will we consolidate information to show the user?
--> preliminar structure is methods that show data + graphs for each probe sequence
--> further iteration into GUI + pdf-style downloadable report

Also, does this already exist? (Joe doesn't really mind if it does, but good to know anyways)
Also, what will our reference genome be?
